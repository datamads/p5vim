# p5vim
Startup script for p5js in VIM / TMUX

It's a prerequisite to have TMUX, VIM and P5 Manager (https://github.com/chiunhau/p5-manager/blob/master/README.md) installed. Only tested on MAC OSX and mostly for personal use actually, but still. 

Use this by opening a terminal and executing the command `bash path/to/p5vim-script/p5vim.sh`
